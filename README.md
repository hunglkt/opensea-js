# NFT marketplace demo for Ali

## Let's share our social site accounts here so we can communicate in no matter what.
   But let's don't mention about this on freelancer.com, if freelancer.com knows about this, they will make our accounts invalid and both of us cannot communicate each other.
   Let's make some comfort in interaction.
   
   I use skype only for now. You can find me with my email.

## Opensea Marketplace Clone Website:

We would like a website that very closely resembles Opensea.
The SDK will allow almost a perfect copy of Opensea.

https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/opensea-js/

The functions should be very similar and specially we would require:

-multiple sellers, multiple buyers
-Account creation using a web3 crypto wallet such as Metamask
-Sellers should be able to create collections using NFT using ERC-1155 standard- gasless transactions (again Opensea SDK features this tool)
-Sellers should be able to create and manage their collections like in Opensea.
-The homepage should have some featured collections from sellers, trending collections and new collections.
-Users should be able to search using filters such as
  * Recently Listed
  * Highest Price
  * Recently created
  * Highest Last Sale
  * Expiring Soon
  * Oldest
  * Lowest Price
  * Most Views
  
And finally as we discussed, once a buyer buys the NFT the web3 wallet pays the seller automatically just like Opensea. Payments fully managed by the wallets.

About 25 days.
